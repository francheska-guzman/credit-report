# Project Proposal

### Description

Develop a financial technology web application focused on credit report, that renders user's data previously analyzed in a dashboard (using charts).

### Functionality

In the real life when a user request a credit report in web applications like Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, FreeCreditReport, etc; the user introduce her personal information (first, initial and last name, social security number, date of birth, and so on), and the page render all her financial situation.

In my web application, the user will introduce her "identification number" in an input field, and the app will render her personal/financial information from the database ("Read" from CRUD).

### MVP

* Create a database to add personal/financial information about the user.

* Find a js library to create interactive charts.

* Find an API to get an overall credit score of people in the United States, and compare the user with real public data.

* Make it responsive design.

* Perform cross-browser testing.
