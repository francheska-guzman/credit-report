# Credit Report

### Project Proposal

Develop a credit report web application, that renders user's data previously analyzed in a dashboard (mostly charts).

**Credit factors:**

1. Credit card use (ratios)
2. Payment history (true/false)
3. Derogatory marks
4. Credit age (calculate the average of user's open accounts)
5. Total accounts
6. Hard inquiries

**I will be:**

* Using a database to add personal/financial information about the user.

* Looking for an API to get an overall score of people in the United States, and be able to compare the user with real public data.

* Searching for a library to create interactive charts.
