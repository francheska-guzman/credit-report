### User Stories

1. As a user who doesn't know what is a Credit Report, and the impact of it in my life; I would like to get information about it, including quick tips for my credit health.
2. As a user, I want to get my credit score and a histogram chart to see how my score has changed.
3. As a user interested in get a credit report, I would like to see the following credit factores:<br />
	â€¢ Credit card use<br />
	â€¢ Payment history<br />
	â€¢ Derogatory marks<br />
	â€¢ Credit age<br />
	â€¢ Total accounts<br />
	â€¢ Hard inquiries
4. As a user, I would like a clean dashboard with colorful charts to visualize my financial situation.
5. As a user, I want to protect my personal and financial data by using a login, but I don't know if Francheska have enough time to implement it. (Post-MVP ðŸ˜…)
