## Pseudocode

1. Make an axios call to the Credit Report API, and get the personal and financial information from an especific user.
2. Find the credit use and credit limit for each account open account.
3. Divide credit use by the credit limit, to compute the utilization ratio.
4. Render the result in the Credit Card Use component in the following format: Credit name, Account Type, Credit Use, Credit Limit and the ratio already computed. (Utilization ratio for each account.)
5. Finally, sum the credit use of all accounts, sum the credit limit of all accounts, and divide it. Render the result in a pie chart. (Utilization ratio in general.)

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### APIs:

[Credit Report API](https://creditreportapi.herokuapp.com/) - I created this API to add personal and financial information for users, that I will be using to calculate their credit factors and credit score. This is not a final API, I will be adding more data and tables. Inmediatly I made changes to the database, I will be updating the "[Visual representation of the database](#database)".
