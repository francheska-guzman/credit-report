	* Google Maps API.
	* Verify Trulia, Zillow, and StreetEasy API.


3. Develop a **humanitarian response** web application.
	* 25 Emergency APIs: https://www.programmableweb.com/category/emergency/api


4. Develop a **credit score** web application. Will use a big database with artificial user, and calculate her score in base of that information.
	* API to get an overall score of people in the United States.
